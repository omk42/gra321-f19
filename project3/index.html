    <p>After visiting twice in one summer, Banff National Park became one of our favorite spots in Canada. Although both road trips were too short, one was three nights and the other was two, we were still able to cover quite a bit of ground. One of our favorite pastimes quickly became gazing at the bright blue lakes with rocky mountains in the background. There are so many spectacular lakes throughout the park, and depending on the light, the range of blue hues varied along a spectrum that we never knew was possible. From bright aqua to a milky blue, we witnessed shade after shade.</p>
    <p>In addition to staring at the lakes with our jaws flapping in the wind, we canoed on Moraine Lake twice, camped in two different campgrounds, hiked the Johnston Canyon Trail and the Sulphur Mountain Trail, rode the Banff Gondola, soaked in the warm waters of the Banff Upper Hot Springs, explored the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and wandered around the adorable downtown area of Banff. </p>
    <p>Banff National Park was Canada’s first national park, and it is situated within the Canadian Rockies mountain range. The park encompasses more than 2,300 square miles of mountains and wilderness. While we still have so much of the park left to see, we have already fallen in love with this slice of mountain paradise. Here’s a peek into our two adventures through the park—hopefully we can add visit number three to the list soon!</p>
    <p>Lake Louise is located a short drive from the Village of Lake Louise. Just like many of the lakes throughout the park, the glacial lake is a bright turquoise and surrounded by snow capped mountains. There are several hiking trails, canoes are available for rent, and a beautiful castle-like hotel, the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, overlooks the lake.
